## Overview
---

This repository is for the project of **Udacity Nanodegree - Self-driving Car Engineer : PID Controller Proejct**.  It is forked from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project).  


The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Understand how PID controller works and effect of each P/I/D component
* Implement PID Controller in C++

## Outputs

This project has 3 types of outputs:
1. source code : main.cpp, PID.cpp, PID.h
~~~sh
# To build to source code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./pid
# then launch the simulator
~~~

2. writeup.md : writeup file that specify details on how I completed this project.
3. ./writeup_images/Final_Lap.mp4 : autonomous driving video
